                Nation Namer is an educational and fun geography game that helps players learn the locations of countries on the map. Though it may seem that the order in which the countries appear in the game are random, countries with larger populations (which are, presumably, easier to label) are more likely to be appear earlier in the game- that's why countries with massive populations like China, India, and the US appear early on in the game while countries with tiny populations, like Nauru, Tuvalu, and Montserrat appear near the end of the game. This way, the game increases with difficulty as one plays. Fun Fact: I designed all the icons myself!
