Nation Namer is a fun and educational geography game website that helps players learn the locations of different countries on a map. The order in which the countries appear in the game is not random, but rather is based on the population size of each country. Countries with larger populations, which may be more easily recognizable, tend to appear earlier in the game. This is why countries with large populations like China, India, and the United States appear early in the game, while countries with smaller populations like Nauru, Tuvalu, and Montserrat appear later on. As a result, the game increases in difficulty as the player progresses. The entire website's code is available for viewing on my Github: github[dot]com/bilalAhmadAyoub.
